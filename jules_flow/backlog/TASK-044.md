### Descrição

Implementar os testes de componentes e E2E para o frontend do analisador.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Testes de componentes implementados (e.g., usando React Testing Library/Vitest). (BLOQUEADO - Configuração do framework incompleta)
- [ ] Testes E2E implementados (e.g., usando Cypress ou Playwright, se configurado no projeto). (BLOQUEADO - Configuração do framework incompleta)
- [x] Arquivos de configuração para Vitest/RTL preparados (package.json, vite.config.ts, setupTests.ts).

### Arquivos Relevantes

* Arquivos de teste em `frontend/src/components/` ou `frontend/tests/`
* `frontend/package.json`
* `frontend/vite.config.ts`
* `frontend/src/setupTests.ts`

### Relatório de Execução

Successfully modified `frontend/package.json` and `frontend/vite.config.ts`, and created `frontend/src/setupTests.ts` to configure Vitest and React Testing Library.

However, the crucial `npm install` step failed repeatedly due to a persistent issue with the `run_in_bash_session` tool. This means the new testing dependencies are not installed, and the testing setup is therefore incomplete and non-functional.

Details:
- `package.json`: devDependencies for vitest, @vitest/ui, jsdom, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event were added. Test scripts ("test", "test:ui") were added.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vitest configuration (globals, environment, setupFiles, css) was added under the `test` property, and the necessary triple-slash directive for types was included.
- `src/setupTests.ts`: File created with `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';`.

The inability to install dependencies prevents Vitest from running and blocks the implementation of actual tests.
The task status is changed to 'blocked' pending manual installation of dependencies.
The modified configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `setupTests.ts`) are part of this task's deliverable, even though the installation failed.

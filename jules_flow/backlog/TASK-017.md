TASK BLOCKED

Attempted to execute tests for the `documents` module's upload endpoint as required by this task.
However, test execution was prevented by a persistent environment error: "Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution. This is unexpected. All changes to the repo have been rolled back."

This is the same critical environment issue that affected TASK-014 and TASK-016, preventing test verification and potentially rolling back file modifications within subtasks.

Since this task solely relies on successful test execution, it cannot be completed until the underlying environment issue is resolved.

This task is now marked as 'blocked'. Manual intervention by a developer is required to fix the testing environment.

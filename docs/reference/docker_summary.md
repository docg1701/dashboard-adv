# Docker Summary

This document provides a summary of key Docker concepts and practices relevant to this project, focusing on Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, and best practices.

## Dockerfiles

A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Key Instructions & Concepts:
- `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
- `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
- `COPY` / `ADD`: Copies files/directories into the Docker image. `COPY` is generally preferred.
- `RUN`: Executes commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results. Used for installing packages, etc.
- `CMD` / `ENTRYPOINT`: Specify what command to run when the container starts. `ENTRYPOINT` configures a container that will run as an executable. `CMD` provides defaults for an executing container, which can be overridden.
- `EXPOSE`: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. Does not actually publish the port.
- `ENV`: Sets environment variables.
- `ARG`: Defines build-time variables.

### Multi-stage Builds
Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image. This is extremely useful for creating lean production images by separating build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies.

Example:
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM golang:1.17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Stage 2: Create the production image
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
CMD ["./myapp"]
```

### Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles
- **Keep images small:** Only include necessary files and dependencies. Use multi-stage builds.
- **Use a `.dockerignore` file:** Exclude files and directories not needed for the build (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules` if dependencies are installed in the image).
- **Minimize layers:** Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a layer. Group related commands (e.g., multiple `RUN` commands for package installation) to reduce the number of layers.
- **Order matters for caching:** Place instructions that change less frequently (like installing dependencies) before instructions that change more frequently (like copying source code) to leverage Docker's build cache effectively.
- **Use official and verified base images:** Start with trusted base images from Docker Hub.
- **Be specific with tags:** Avoid using `latest` tag for base images in production; use specific version tags (e.g., `python:3.9-slim`).
- **Run as non-root user:** Create and switch to a non-root user in the Dockerfile for better security.
- **Understand `CMD` vs `ENTRYPOINT`:** Use them appropriately for your container's purpose.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (typically `docker-compose.yml`) to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.

Key Concepts & Configuration:
- **Services:** Define the different containers that make up your application (e.g., web server, database, message broker). Each service is built from a Dockerfile or a pre-built image.
- **`build` vs `image`:**
    - `build`: Specifies the path to a Dockerfile to build an image for the service.
    - `image`: Specifies a pre-built image to use (e.g., `postgres:15` or `redis:7`).
- **`ports`:** Maps ports from the host to the container (e.g., ` "8080:80"`).
- **`volumes`:** Mounts host paths or named volumes into containers for persistent storage or sharing data (e.g., `db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` or `./my_code:/app`).
- **`environment`:** Sets environment variables for services.
- **`depends_on`:** Specifies service dependencies, controlling startup order (though it only waits for the container to *start*, not necessarily for it to be *ready*).
- **`networks`:** Defines custom networks for services to communicate. By default, Compose sets up a single default network for your app.
- **`command`:** Overrides the default command for a service's container.

### Common Docker Compose Commands
- `docker-compose up`: Builds (if necessary), creates, starts, and attaches to containers for an application. Add `-d` to run in detached mode.
- `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes containers, networks, and optionally volumes (with `-v`).
- `docker-compose build [service_name]`: Builds or rebuilds images for services.
- `docker-compose ps`: Lists containers.
- `docker-compose logs [service_name]`: Displays log output from services.
- `docker-compose exec <service_name> <command>`: Executes a command in a running container.
- `docker-compose run <service_name> <command>`: Runs a one-off command on a service (creates a new container).

### Using Compose in Development vs. Production
- **Development:**
    - Use bind mounts for source code to reflect changes immediately.
    - Expose ports for debugging.
    - May use lighter base images or include dev tools.
- **Production:**
    - Avoid bind mounts for application code; code should be built into the image.
    - Don't expose unnecessary ports.
    - Use minimal, secure base images.
    - Manage secrets appropriately (e.g., Docker secrets, environment variables injected securely).
    - Consider using multiple Compose files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` for base, `docker-compose.override.yml` for development, `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production overrides) to tailor configurations.

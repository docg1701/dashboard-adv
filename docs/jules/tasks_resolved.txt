Task: Fix frontend blank page and console error related to ProtectedRoute.
Issue: Frontend displayed a blank page. Browser console showed error: "The result of getSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop".
Root Cause: Infinite loop in `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`. The Zustand store selector `state => ({ token: state.token, user: state.user })` was returning a new object reference on each component render, causing unnecessary re-renders and leading to the loop.
File(s) Modified: frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
Summary of Fix: Replaced the problematic selector with two individual, stable selectors:
  `const token = useAuthStore(state => state.token);`
  `const user = useAuthStore(state => state.user);`
Outcome: Fix implemented. Frontend development server (Vite) starts and remains stable, indicating the critical loop is resolved. Direct browser verification of console error disappearance was not possible in the test environment, but the fix is standard practice for this type of Zustand/React issue.
